A man cannot capture a king. If a player can capture an equal number of pieces with a man and a king, he must do so with the king.  If a player can capture an equal number of pieces with a king, but each option has a different number of kings, he must make the move that captures the maximum number of opponent's kings possible. If a player can capture an equal number of pieces with each series containing an equal number of kings with a king, he must capture wherever the opponent's king occurs first. Otherwise, the player may choose the sequence in which to capture.
