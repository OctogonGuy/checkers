Invented by Christian Freeling in 2000. Each player's pieces are arranged forming a trapezoid shape. Men move orthogonally forward (not sideways) and diagonally forward. Kings move orthogonally and diagonally. Both men and kings capture orthogonally in all directions. Men have a special linear movement ability in which they may move along an unbroken line of men of the same color, provided the square in front is vacant. This can be just a single man or many men.
