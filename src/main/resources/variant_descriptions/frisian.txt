In a capturing sequence, kings are worth one and a half the value of a man. Movement is diagonal, but captures can be made both diagonally and orthogonally on squares of the same color. This means that if a capture is made orthogonally, the piece can move four squares in that direction. Kings can only move three times in a row. The king can be freed by moving another piece but also by making a capture. A game ends in a draw if one player has 2 kings, the other player has 1 king, and the game continues for 7 turns.
